#  2.  What is the probability of winning a lottery that requires you to pick 6 numbers from 1-49, inclusive?  
#      The 6 numbers are unique so you can't pick the same number twice.    
#      What is the probability of getting at least 3 of them right?  
#      (a)  Simulate the result and provide figures.
